  Kurz:         Guru Meditation Fehlerprüfer mit umfassender Fehlerdatenbank

  Insight is a comprehensive Guru Meditation error checker for AmigaOS that
  reads the LastAlert array from SysBase and provides detailed explanations
  for system errors. It includes an extensive database of error codes with
  troubleshooting guidance to help developers understand and fix system crashes.

  Features:
  - Automatically checks SysBase LastAlert array for system errors
  - Comprehensive database of Guru Meditation error codes
  - Detailed error descriptions and troubleshooting insights
  - Command-line mode: Look up specific error codes

  Requirements:
  - AmigaOS 3.2 or higher (requires requester.class for error dialogs)

  Usage:
  
  Workbench mode:
  When launched from Workbench (double-click the Insight icon), Insight will:
  
  1. Read the LastAlert array from SysBase
  2. Check if an error code exists (not 0xFFFFFFFF)
  3. Look up the error in the comprehensive database
  4. Display a requester dialog with the error description and troubleshooting guidance
  5. Exit after displaying the error

  If no error is detected, Insight exits silently.

  Command-line mode:
  
  Check LastAlert:
    Insight
  
  This will check SysBase LastAlert and print the error information to the console.
  If no error exists, it exits with success status.

  Look up specific error code:
    Insight ERROR=8000000B
    Insight ERROR=0x8000000B
    Insight 8000000B
  
  You can specify an error code using the ERROR keyword, with or without the 0x
  prefix. You can also simply provide the hex number directly without the ERROR
  keyword. The error code must be exactly 8 hexadecimal digits.

  Test mode (random error):
    Insight GURU
  
  This displays a random error from the database in a requester dialog. Useful
  for testing the interface and exploring the error database.

  Examples:
  - Check for system errors:
    Insight
    → Reads LastAlert from SysBase and displays any errors found

  - Look up a specific error:
    Insight ERROR=8000000B
    → Displays information about "Illegal instruction" error

  - Test the error dialog:
    Insight GURU
    → Shows a random error in a requester dialog

  - Combine test mode with specific error:
    Insight ERROR=01000005 GURU
    → Looks up error 0x01000005 and displays it in a dialog

  How It Works:
  Insight reads the LastAlert array from the ExecBase structure (SysBase).
  The LastAlert array contains the last 4 system alert codes:
  
  - LastAlert[0]: The most recent alert code (error code)
  - LastAlert[1]: Additional error information
  - LastAlert[2]: More error context
  - LastAlert[3]: Task ID that caused the error

  Insight first checks memory at address 0x0100 (where some systems store
  error data), and if that's empty, falls back to reading SysBase->LastAlert[0].

  The error code is then looked up in Insight's comprehensive database, which
  includes:
  - CPU exceptions (bus errors, address errors, illegal instructions, etc.)
  - Exec library errors (memory corruption, semaphore errors, etc.)
  - Graphics library errors (out of memory, copper list errors, etc.)
  - Intuition library errors (gadget errors, window errors, etc.)
  - DOS library errors (disk errors, file system errors, etc.)
  - Device errors (timer, audio, keyboard, etc.)
  - And many more categories

  Each error entry includes:
  - Error code (hexadecimal)
  - Short description
  - Detailed troubleshooting guidance

  Error Database:
  Insight includes one of the most comprehensive Guru Meditation error code
  databases available, with detailed explanations for hundreds of error codes
  covering all major AmigaOS subsystems. The database is based on official
  Amiga documentation and real-world troubleshooting experience.

  Limitations:
  - Requires AmigaOS 3.2
  - The concept of the SysBase LastAlert does not exist on OS4. Insight will do 
  nothing and exit silently when run on OS4.
